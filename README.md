# JQuery Tools #

JQuery Tools is an attractive set of jQuery plugins for many common tasks. It's extremely well documented, and has some great functionality out of the box.

## About this Fork ##

Since JQuery tools has yet to release their code on Github, I took the liberty of putting up a version. It will stay in sync with their updates, along with additional bug fixes and refactoring.

JQuery Tools has a great UI and functionality, but it needs a bit of a refactoring. Using jQuery custom event mechanism would be a huge improvement so you can more easily bind and trigger events.

Eventually, I'd like to turn this fork into a "proper" implementation of these plugins. Would love any help on this, so please fork this repo and submit patches.
